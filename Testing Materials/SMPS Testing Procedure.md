# General Notes
- General convention: 
	- refdes will be displayed as **BOLD**
	- net names will be displayed as `NET_NAME`
	- components will be displayed as *Groups*.
		- Many components will be in *Common* if they don't have a dedicated *Group*, such as pull-up resistor.
	- MCU pins will also be displayed as *MCU Pins*.
	- Warning will be displayed as ***LIKE THIS***.
- All measurements will be done with x100 probe.
- For Assembly:
	- Cut stencil up if feasible
	- Assembly block by block from the *groups* according to the testing document.
- ***MINIMIZE*** the amount of interactions you have with live circuits.
	- Avoid probing the circuit, to prevent the chances of an ***ARCS***.
- When soldering on components, make sure the circuit is disconnected.
- ***IF INTERACTING WITH LIVE CIRCUIT, WEAR HIGH VOLTAGE GLOVES***
	- Be wary of any ***ARCS***
		- For example, the micro USB metal shell is a live `GND`.
- ***DO NOT TOUCH CAPACITORS ON THE CIRCUIT***
	- If you need to touch them for any reason, wait for them to discharge (based on the number below).
- ***DO NOT UPLOAD CODE TO THE ESP32 WHEN THE BOARD IS ON.***
	- Take it off, upload the code, and then put it on.
        - Test scripts can be found in the Firmware/Test Scripts directory.

# 1. Input Circuit
1. This is to verify the input circuit does rectify the AC input.
2. Solder **BR1, F1, F2, J1, R15, R16, R99** from the *Input* and test points for `PRI_GND` & `UNREG_DC`.
	- Place a 12A FB fuse across **F1** & **F2**.
3. Test the input:
	- AC output on `UNREG_DC` with rocker switch OFF (no output)
	- AC output on `UNREG_DC` with rocker switch ON (Expected Full-Wave), recording the Vpp.
4. Desolder **BR1** and solder on **D1, D2, D3, D4** from the *Input*.
5. Test the input:
	- AC output on `UNREG_DC` with rocker switch OFF (no output)
	- AC output on `UNREG_DC` with rocker switch ON (Expected Full-Wave), recording the Vpp.
6. If the AC output for `UNREG_DC` has higher Vpp, then keep **D1, D2, D3, D4** on and move to step 6. Otherwise, desolder **D1, D2, D3, D4**, and solder on **BR1**. 
	- Verify the AC Output for `UNREG_DC` is the same as before if using **BR1** before continuing on.
7. Solder on **C7, C8, C9, C10, C11** from the *Input*.
8. Test the filtered input:
	- AC output on `UNREG_DC` (Expected near DC output, record ripple).
		- Can swap out capacitors with bigger value alternative capacitors from JLab to see if the rippling can be reduced significantly.
	- Check capacitor voltage is 0V after the rocker switch is OFF for 120 seconds.
		- This is the ***universal wait time*** for capacitors to discharge.
		- Note: Might need to wait longer if the capacitance was increased.

## Channel A LVDD
1. This is to test the `A_5V` & `A_3V3` rail.
2. Solder on **C1, C3, C4, C5, C12, D41, L1, L5, R94, U2** from the *LVDD* and test points for `A_GND`, `A_5V`.

2. Solder on **C37, R46, R47, U7**.
3. Solder on $50k\Omega$ for **R54**.
	- Run the Channel_A_Temp_Sense.cpp file.

		- Make sure the temperature sensor sends a LOW signal with hot air gun at $55^{\circ}C$ aimed at the temperature sensor and this is displayed on the LCD.
			- The temperature sensor should go off at around $53^{\circ}C$.
4. Determine what an appropiate resistor/temperature cut off is.
	- Few choices here. Recommend using a lower temperature threshold first before moving onto higher threshold.
		- $50k\Omega$ for $53^\circ C$ threshold
		- $30k\Omega$ for $79^{\circ}C$ threshold
		- $15k\Omega$ for $100^{\circ}C$ threshold

## Channel A Transformers

3. Check the flyback transformer outputs VDC at `FLY_OUT_A`.
	- Run the Channel_A_Transformer1.cpp file.
		- With the MCU, send a fixed PWM at 10kHz with a duty cycle of 25% on *A_DRIVE* and record the VDC at `FLY_OUT_A` (should be approximately 10.9V $\pm$ 2V) & record how long it takes for output to settle (call this *time1*).
			- ***MAKE SURE THE DUTY CYCLE IS BELOW 50% ALWAYS***.
  			- Verify the frequency used has the expected VDC output, if not repeat with a different frequency increasing order of 10kHz.
				- ***DO NOT GO ABOVE 50kHz!***.
		- Verify one last time that `PRI_GND` and `A_GND` are isolated from each other (using a voltmeter).
		- Check capacitor voltage is 0V after the rocker switch is OFF after the ***universal wait time***. 
		- If the ripple is above 50mV, change the **C24, C25, C26** to a higher capacitance after ***universal wait time*** and redo step 3.
4. Record PWM duty cycle vs. VDC output.
	- Run the Channel_A_Transformer2.cpp file.
		- Measure the duty cycle from 21V to 9.5V in 0.10V intervals after waiting *time1* seconds.
			- If duty cycle to voltage is nonlinear, use a line of best fit to estimate.
		- Some extra notes
			- The 12V number will be used for LV circuit.
			- These ***won't*** be the final numbers used to associate output for Channel A and PWM duty cycle, since there will be a voltage drop (i.e. there's a diode in line to prevent reverse polarity). 
			- The flyback transformer is expected to output 20V to 10V in normal operation. The 21V and 9.5V values helps to ensure that all boundary conditions are tested and an upper/lower duty cycle can be found for the firmware (+ to account for voltage drop).

## Channel A HV/LV 
1. This is to test the HV & LV relays + buck converter.
2. Solder on **C23, D5, D6, K1, K2, L3, Q1, Q2, Q3, Q5, Q7, R17, R18, R21** from the *HV/LV* and test points `OUT_A_HV`, `OUT_A_LV`,`BUCK_A_\P\W\M`, `BUCK_A_PWM`,`OUT_A_BUCK`, and `OUT_A_CURR`.
3. Test HV side (through line)
	- Send a LOW signal to *A_HV_LV_OUT*. 
	- Confirm that the input from `FLY_OUT_A` appears at `OUT_A_HV` and `OUT_A_CURR`. 
		- `OUT_A_LV` should be floating.
4. Test LV side (buck converter)
	- Send a HIGH signal to *A_HV_LV_OUT* with `A_FLY_OUT_A` set to 12VDC and *A_BUCK* is set to 50% duty cycle.
		- Confirm you hear the relays click as the *A_HV_LV_OUT* changes.
	- Confirm that `FLY_OUT_A` and `OUT_A_LV` are both 12V. 
		- `OUT_A_HV` should be floating.
	- Confirm `OUT_A_BUCK` and `OUT_A_CURR` are the expected voltage (around 6V). 
		- If this isn't the case, move onto step 5. If it does work, move onto step 7.
5. Desolder **Q1, Q3** and solder on **Q12, Q56** (these are on the back). 
6. Run the tests from step 4 again.
7. Testing buck converter duty cycle vs. voltage output.
	- Similar to the transformer, record the duty cycle to output voltage of the buck converter from 10V to 2V in 0.25V intervals.
		- If duty cycle to voltage is nonlinear, use a line of best fit to estimate.
	- Some extra notes
		- These ***won't*** be the final numbers used to associate output for Channel A and PWM duty cycle, since there will be a voltage drop (i.e. there's a diode in line to prevent reverse polarity). 
		- The buck converter is expected to output 10V to 1V in normal operation. The 2V lower end is because the buck converter can operate strange in the lower voltage ends, so the 1V should be tested more thoroughly later on.

	- Make sure it is still working properly and there isn't any significant change (i.e. it doesn't become hot).
